    <h1>INTRODUCTORY</h1>
    <h2>Introducing Web Development</h2>
    <h1>Setting up the development enviroment(vs code)</h1>
    <b>Introduction to version contol with git and github,program flow and Algorithms,
       and flow charts, variables, data types,and operators.</b>
   <p><strong>web development:</strong></p>
    <p>This is the process of building, creating, and maintainig websites.
        It encompasess various asspects, including web design, web content development,
        client-side scripting, and network security configuration.</p>
        <u><h1> the course tools</h1></u>
 <p><strong>1. text editor:</strong></p>
       <P>such as visual studio code, bracket, atom e.t.c.</P>
 <p><strong>2. web browser:</p></strong>
        <P>Google chrome, mozilla fire fox, safari.</P>
 <p><strong>3. local saver enviroment:</strong></p>
        <P>XAMPP.</P>
 <p><strong>4. version coontrol system:</strong></p>
        <P>Github for tracing changes and managing source</P>
     <h2>visual studio code (VS CODE)</h2>
     <p><strong> It is a free open-source editor developed by micro soft.
        it is opular among web deveopers due to to it light weight nature, rich programing
        language. incluing htmls, CSS, javascript, PHP, phython, and more making it a versatile
        tool for deveopers.</strong></p>
         <U><strong><b>Essential Extension</b></strong></U>
 <h1>1. Live server:</h1><b>lauches a local development server with reload feacture
                  for satre and dynamic pages.</b>
 <h1>2. Prethier-code formatting:</h1><b>formats your code to make 
                  it consistence and easier to reader.</b>
 <h1>3. HTML:</h1><b>provides html code snipets for faster coding.</b>
 <h1>4. CSS Snipets:</h1><p>provides CSS code snipets for faster styling.</p>
 <h1>5. Version control:</h1> it is the pratice of tracing and managing changes to 
                  software code. version control system are essential for teams of deveopers to
                  colaborate on project without conflicting each other.
 <h1>6. Git:</h1><b>it is a distributed version control system that allows multple people 
                  to work on a project at the same width without interfering each other work.
                  It keeps record of changes made to files,which allows yiu to revert  to previous 
                  version if neccessary.</b>
 <h1>7. Github:</h1><b>it is a platform that allows deveopers to store, manage, and
                  share their code respository.</b>            
                  <h1><u>Using Git and Github</u></h1>
                  <em>Step1.</em><strong>create a respository:</strong> 
                             <b>initialize a new respository locally or on your Github.</b>
                  <em>Step2.</em><strong>make changes:</strong>
                             <b>Add, modify, or delete files in your project.</b>
                  <em>STEP3.</em><strong>commite changes:</strong>
                             <b>Save snapshots of your projects history.</b>
                  <em>Step4.</em><strong>push to Github:</strong>
                             <b>upload your changes to Github to backup your code and share it with others.</b>
                  <em>Step5.</em><strong>colaborate:</strong>
                             <b>use Github to work together with other deveopers, manage issues, and trace 
                               progress of your projects.</b>
                           <h1>programming logic with javascript basics:</hi>
                      <p>programming logic forms is the foundation of writing effectve and efficient code,
                          understanding how structure programms and server problems is essential for any aspiring
                          deveopers</p>
                  <h1>Programms and Algorithms:</h1> 
                  <strong>Programms:</strong>
                  <p>Programms are set of instruction that a computer follows to perform specific tasks. these 
                      instruction are written in programming language like javascript.</p>
                  <strong>Algorithms:</strong>
                  <p>They are steps procedures or formulas for solving problems. they are blue prints of a program,
                      defining the sequenece  of operartion that need to be executed to achieve the desire outcome.</p>
